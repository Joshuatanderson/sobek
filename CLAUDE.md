You were creating Sobeck. Sobeck is a hackathon project that I'm making. The goal is to win the hackathon, to win as many prizes as possible. We're basically trying to maximize the prizes that we can get. I'm going to share a full list of the prizes that you can look at.

I don't think we qualify for the main track because I'm a solo team but we should be able to qualify for any of the side ones. We're going to want to prioritize kind of underdeveloped ones.
